# TerminalNotes

The lightest  weight notes app I could think of building, no security, no fluff. Uses tinydb and a couple lines of python.

Inspired by [tnote](https://github.com/tasdikrahman/tnote/tree/master), I just forgot my password and got frustrated one day and wanted to build something without authentication.

Made with python3, just clone the repo and run 
``` python3 main.py ```
